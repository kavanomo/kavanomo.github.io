            <p>Assembly is where you realize that all the parts you thought would fit together try really hard but then decide they don't have it in them. I'm largely referring to the chain joining the two sprockets and leads-crews. I am infinitely grateful to my past self for having the forethought to order 3 feet of chain instead of exactly what I needed. I'm also grateful YouTube has tutorial on how to connect and change the length of chains. I quickly discovered the tower has to be assembled in a very specific order or you have to backtrack a few steps. Faye tried to take an assembly video which ended up riddled with 'And I messed up so we're just gonna pretend that didn't happen and I'll go back a few steps'.</p>

            <p class="blog-post-meta">March 2, 2019 by Misha</p>
            <p>This week was mostly a machining week. The most exciting things I had to do is use an over foot long drill bit in the mill to make holes from the outside of the part so that they could be located inside the elevator shaft. I also milled the 3D printed Pi Platform. Don't do this! It melts the plastic and comes out really rough but it reduced the width as I wanted. The drilling of the 1.5mm acrylic was even more questionable but I had forgotten holes for the clear door hinges and wanted to hand the assembled part off to the electrical and firmware wizards of the team to tinker with.</p>
